# SurfWrite

A full stack JavaScript application for surfers who want to keep track and log the days they went surfing.

## Why I Built This

I have several friends that like to surf and who have introduced me to the sport. I noticed that my friends would upload their surfing progress through other social media sites, but there wasn't a way for them to keep record of their progess in a personal journal or diary-like form. I wanted to build an application that was solely focused on surfing, where my friends could conveniently keep track and write journal logs.
